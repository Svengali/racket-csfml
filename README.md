# CSFML Bindings for Racket

This is a _complete_ FFI wrapper for [CSFML 2.5][csfml]. It also consists of few helper functions - in the same style - to simplify very common FFI code (e.g. event handling).

## Installation

Install with `raco`:

```bash
$ raco pkg install csfml
```

## Quickstart Examples

It's expected that you know [CSFML][csfml] and know the types, functions, etc. But, examples of using it from [Racket][racket] can be found [here][examples].
